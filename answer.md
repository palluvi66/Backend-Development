Q4:What is the Client–Server Model? Explain:
Who is the client
Who is the server
How communication happens between them
Answer:The Client–Server Model is a network architecture in which clients request services or resources and a server provides those services.
It divides work between:
Client → Requests and user interface
Server → Processing, storage, and business logic
1. Client
The client is the user’s device or application that:
Sends requests to the server
Displays the user interface
Takes user input and sends it to the server
Examples of clients:
Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox),Mobile apps,Desktop applications
The client focuses on presentation and user interaction.

2. Server
The server is a powerful system that receives client requests, processes data and business logic,Manages databases,Sends responses back to the client
The server works continuously and serves many clients at the same time.
3. Communication Happens Between Client and Server
Communication happens through the request–response cycle:
-The client sends a request (usually HTTP/HTTPS)
-The server receives and processes the request
-The server performs required operations (business logic, database access, authentication, etc.)
-The server sends a response back to the client
-The client displays the result to the user
This communication is done over the internet using protocols like HTTP and HTTPS.

Q5. Three-Tier Architecture
What is 3-Tier Architecture in web applications? Explain each layer:
Presentation Layer
Application (Business) Layer
Data Layer
Also mention why this architecture is used.

Answer: Three-Tier Architecture is a software design model that divides a web application into three separate layers, each with a specific responsibility.
This separation makes the system more organized, scalable, and maintainable.

The three layers are Three-Tier Architecture are
1. Presentation Layer
2. Application (Business) Layer
3. Data Layer

1. Presentation Layer
This is the user interface layer.
It includes:Web pages,Forms, buttons, menus,All visual components
Responsibilities of this layer are to display data to the user,Collect user input,Send requests to the application layer
Technologies used in this layer are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, etc.

2. Application (Business) Layer
This is the core logic layer of the application.
Responsibilities of this layer are to process user requests,Apply business rules, perform calculations and validations,Communicate between presentation and data layer

Technologies used in this layer are
Node.js, Java, Python, PHP, .NET, etc.

3. Data Layer
This layer handles data storage and management.
Responsibilities of this layer are to store and retrieve data,Manage database operations (CRUD),Ensure data integrity and security
Technologies used in this layer are MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle, etc.

This architecture is used because it provides better maintainability – each layer can be updated independently,Scalability – layers can be scaled separately,Improved security – data layer is not directly exposed,Clear separation of concerns – easier development and testing,High reliability – failure in one layer doesn’t crash the whole system.
